# Porglet file conversion

To use, simple download the files you want to convert from the IQ library and then run [iqConvert](./iqConvert.py).  

Note iqConvert will ask if you want to convert a remote or local directory, so you do not have to run the script from the directory that you want to convert.  It will then run through the directory and convert every `.16sc` file into it's `.sc16` and `.cfile` format.
